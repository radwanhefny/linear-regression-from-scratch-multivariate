# linear-regression-from-scratch-multivariate
This project implements Multivariate Linear Regression completely from scratch using Python — without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn. The goal is to understand the math behind the model, how gradient descent works, and how to build a full ML pipeline manually.
